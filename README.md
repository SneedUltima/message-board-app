Full Stack Message-Board application built with React JS and tailwind on the frontend with Express Js, Mongoose and MongoDB used to serve the backend of the application.

Purpose of project was to gain experience using Express, Mongoose and MongoDB for backend development (Serve pages, data from database etc.), as well as user authentication with JSON web tokens and bcrypt. Experience was gained also with Tailwind CSS used to style the frontend components.

Users are able to view facts posted to the message board by other users on the index page. To add a fact to the message board, the user must either login or signup for an account. Users who are not logged in will be unable to view the authors of the facts posts.
